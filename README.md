# Challenge-one-Horiseon

## Description

For this week's challenge, I'm hired by a Marketing agency to help refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Work Completed 

* Changed the website title.
* Fixed the broke link within the website. 
* Used semantic element tags to make the document look neater and easier to read.
* Added alt attributes to each image on the document to help make the website more accessible for the user.
* Changed CSS to sync corretly with new semantic element tags 
* Input comments to where I made changes and explained why I made those changes to the best of my abilities.
